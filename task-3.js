/**
 * 
 * Similar to previous task, Write a `for` loop that goes from 0 until `max` (not included) with an increment
 * defined by the variable `step` and prints every number to the console. 
 * 
 * If the value of `step` is greater than the value of `max`, print a message to the console
 * warning the user that the first argument should always be greater than the second
 * 
 * **IMPORTANT**: the input coming from the command line is always a string. When you
 * need numbers, remember to convert it
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * node task-3.js 10 2 
 * 
 * Expected output:
 * 
 * 0
 * 2
 * 4
 * 6
 * 8
 * 
 * But:
 * node task-3.js 2 5
 * 
 * Expected output:
 * Attention: the first number must be greater than the second!
